# ToDo, transform this in markdown

remember the docker file command, like COPY . /.../...


command to build the tomcat container:.
docker image build -t yogeshraheja/tomcatone:v2 --build-arg tomcat_version=8.5.8 .


you can commit a image, if you change some datails and would like to save the image with command:
When this command is used, the default acction pause the image to avoid corruption data 
	docker contianer commit -m "messagem" <target image> <commited image>

What I've been learn is:
	Docker save is for save image
	Docker export is for container 
	Docker commit is not recomended, but works

# Build context:
  The idea behind build context, is just to show that the file from deamon could be a server and docker CLI could be a client. So, docker build will aways work, because a temp directory will be created to run de COPY instruction on Dockerfile
