# ToDo, transform this in markdown

remember the docker file command, like COPY . /.../...


command to build the tomcat container:.
docker image build -t yogeshraheja/tomcatone:v2 --build-arg tomcat_version=8.5.8 .


you can commit a image, if you change some datails and would like to save the image with command:
When this command is used, the default acction pause the image to avoid corruption data 
	docker contianer commit -m "messagem" <target image> <commited image>

What I've been learn is:
	Docker save is for save image
	Docker export is for container 
	Docker commit is not recomended, but works

# Build context:
  The idea behind build context, is just to show that the file from deamon could be a server and docker CLI could be a client. So, docker build will aways work, because a temp directory will be created to run de COPY instruction on Dockerfile
  You can build from a repository using:
    docker build https://github.com/myaccount....
    
    docker build https://github.com/myaccount....#branch

    docker build https://github.com/myaccount....:folder

    docker build -f <Dockerfile path> https://github.com/myaccount...

# Build cache:
  Remeber to  use COPY instaction as the last, because when changes happens to the code, docker layers below will be invalidated from cache

# ADD instruction:
  ADD extract the file if its necessary and can download the file too
  Use COPY whenever as possible

# verificar como passar parâmetro pra docker rund, ou build

# Diference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT
  CMD didn't accept parameter, but ENTRYPOINT accept. More over, its possible to use both of them, for instance.   Use ENTRYPOINT first and than use CMD as a default parameter from ENTRYPOINT

# Muito interessante em dividir o build de container em etapas para manter o tamanho da imgem pequeno (SERÁ NECESSÁRIO REVER ISSO), no caso foi utilizado a imagem node pra sanar dependencias do node, depois um script para mandar o que foi buildado para o container. Verificar se isso vale a pena mesmo. Me parece que poderia ser buildado no pipeline
